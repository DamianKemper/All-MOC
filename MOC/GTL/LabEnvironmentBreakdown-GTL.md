This lab environment is a controlled lab environment in Azure, for this reason please follow the instructions closely. Do not change names or locations. 

When in the Lab environment do not use your personal login information. Use the provided login criteria posted in the Resources Tab.

You are given 60 minutes for each lab. You will be allowed to extend the labs, as needed. Click ‘yes’ if you need more time. Once you complete a lab you can mark it as complete or cancel it if you have not finished it. Each lab can be launched a maximum of 5 times. After completing or cancelling a lab, that lab window closes. You will need to go back to the initial lab log in page to launch the next lab.

### Power Options
Using the Power Options ( ![Power Options](https://github.com/LODSContent/All-MOC/blob/master/MOC/GTL/images/PowerOptions.png?raw=true) ) button in the top left-hand corner of the lab UI, you can:
1. Send commands to the Virtual Machine, such as Ctrl + Alt + Del, Alt + Tab or any other combination with the Windows key.
1. Leverage the Type Text feature to type text into the Virtual Machine by selecting 'Type clipboard text.'
1. Send shutdown, start and reboot commands to the Virtual Machine.
1. Display a virtual keyboard.
1. Reset your lab's internet connectivity.
  1. Note: This is only to be used in the event that your connectivity has failed.
  
### Display Options
Using the Display Options ( ![Display Options](https://github.com/LODSContent/All-MOC/blob/master/MOC/GTL/images/DisplayOptions.png?raw=true) ) button in the top left-hand corner of the lab UI, you can:
1. Set your lab window to fullscreen. Your Virtual Machine's resolution will adjust to *best* fill the space.
1. Fit your lab window to your Virtual Machine's resolution.
  1. This is beneficial if you maximize your lab window, then want to get rid of the gray space around the Virtual Machine.
1. Initiate a reconnect attempt between your local computer and the Virtual Machine. This is helpful if you have been disconnected from your lab's Virtual Machine.

You can resize the instruction panel (on right) by hovering on the left edge of it and dragging. You can also adjust the font size.

The +++TypeText+++ tool is provided in your labs to make the input of long text easier. Ensure your cursor is in the correct area in the portal/browser window and then Click the T tool. Otherwise, you can always copy and paste it.

Hope you enjoy the lab experience!
