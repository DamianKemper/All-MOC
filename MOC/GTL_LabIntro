# The Lab Environment:

This lab environment is a controlled lab environment in Azure, for this reason please follow the instructions closely. Do not change names or locations.

When in the Lab environment do not use your personal login information. Use the provided login criteria posted in the Resources Tab.

You are given 60 minutes for each lab. You will be allowed to extend the labs, as needed. Click ‘yes’ if you need more time. Once you complete a lab you can mark it as complete or cancel it if you have not finished it. Each lab can be done a maximum of 3 times. After completing or cancelling a lab, that lab window closes. You will then need to proceed to the next lab.

You can resize the instruction panel (on right) by hovering on the left edge and dragging. You can also adjust the font size.

The +++Type tool+++ is provided in your labs to make the input of long text easier. Ensure your cursor is in the correct area in the portal/browser window and then Click the +++tool+++. Otherwise you can always copy and paste it.
